# Song Generator

## Main Purpose
Song Generator is a unique, interactive website that helps users (primarily the younger
generation, aged 18–30) to discover new music tailored to their immediate emotional
state or activity (mood). The website reduces the time users spend choosing music and
encourages music discovery beyond conventional genres, thus expanding their music
library. The core uniqueness is the focus on mood categorization instead of traditional
genres. Song selection uses randomization, ensuring the user’s generated playlist is
unique and less influenced by algorithms.

## Main Features
- Mood Grid to select different moods
- Navigation bar to navigate between different pages (i.e., Home, Now Playing, Liked, Disliked, and About)
- Audio Player to play .mp3 files per mood/category
- Audio playback functionality to play, pause, skip to next or previous song
